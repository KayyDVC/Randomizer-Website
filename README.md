# Hi All,
This was one of my first websites that randomizes a given list of strings/characters separated by a space.
It most likely will not receive any updates, but it's still near and dear to my journey.

The project uses HTML, very basic CSS, and a few lines of Java script to have addList, resetList, and randomizeList functionality.

Thanks,

-Kayy
